# Harness Platform Conventions

## Template-First Workflow

When creating pipelines, always search for existing templates before writing raw steps.
Never invent template names — only use names returned by `harness_list` search results.
If no matching template is found after searching with alternate terms, fall back to `run` steps.

## AI-Generated Tagging

All pipelines created by AI must include the tag `ai_generated: ""` in their tags map.

v0: `tags: { ai_generated: "" }`
v1: add `tags: { ai_generated: "" }` under `pipeline:`

## Pipeline Creation API

`harness_create` accepts a different `resource_type` and body shape for v0 vs v1 pipelines.
**Pick the resource type that matches the YAML you are generating** — they hit different MCP endpoints.

### v1 pipelines (YAML with `pipeline:` as the root key, `${{ }}` expressions, `run:` steps)

```
resource_type: "pipeline_v1"
body: {
  pipeline_yaml: "<YAML string, including 'pipeline:' root>",
  identifier:    "<unique pipeline identifier>",
  name:          "<pipeline display name>"
}
```

- **Required field name is `pipeline_yaml`** (snake_case). `yamlPipeline` is accepted only as a
  backwards-compat alias and should NOT be used for new v1 pipelines.
- **`identifier` and `name` are required** as top-level body fields in addition to being present
  inside the YAML. The MCP uses them for routing.
- Do NOT use `resource_type: "pipeline"` for v1 YAML — that's the v0 legacy endpoint. It may
  tolerate v1 YAML on some Harness versions but is fragile across MCP/backend versions.

### v0 pipelines (YAML with `type: CI`/`type: Deployment` stages, `<+...>` expressions)

```
resource_type: "pipeline"
body: { yamlPipeline: "<YAML string>" }
```

- For v0, the `yamlPipeline` field name (camelCase) is the correct one.
- Do NOT pass a nested JSON `pipeline` object — it causes serialization errors.

## Required Fields the API Rejects Without

- **`failureStrategies`** on every CI and CD stage (v0). v1 equivalent: `on-failure:` block.
  CI stages: use `MarkAsFailure` (v0) or `fail` (v1). CD stages: use `StageRollback` (v0) or `stage-rollback` (v1).
- **`disallowPipelineExecutor: true`** on `HarnessApproval` steps. API returns
  "disallowPipelineExecutor: is missing but it is required" without it.

## Strategy Placement

`strategy` (matrix/for/while) must be a sibling of `spec` at stage level (v0) or directly
on the stage (v1). Placing it inside `spec` causes the matrix to silently not apply.

## Naming Rules

- **Identifiers:** `^[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]{0,127}$` — letters, numbers, underscores only.
- **Stage/step names:** `^[a-zA-Z_0-9-.][-0-9a-zA-Z_\s.]{0,127}$` — no commas.
  Use `Build Test and Push` not `Build, Test and Push`.
- **File names (v1):** alphabets and underscores only (e.g. `build_and_deploy.yaml`).

## Scope and Runtime Inputs

- Use `<+input>` for unknown `connectorRef`, `serviceRef`, `environmentRef`, `infrastructureDefinitions`.
- `orgIdentifier` and `projectIdentifier` must use actual values — never `<+input>`.
- Scope resolution: Account > Org > Project. An entity not found usually means wrong scope,
  not that it doesn't exist.

## Secrets

Always reference via expressions — never hardcode secret values.
`<+secrets.getValue("secret_id")>` (works in both v0 and v1).
